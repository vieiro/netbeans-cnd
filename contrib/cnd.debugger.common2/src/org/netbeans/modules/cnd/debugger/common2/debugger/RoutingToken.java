/**
   A class which represents a routing token/cookie enum, used
   for routing results from dbx to the client code that made
   the request.
   <p>
   The details:
   <p>
    In WorkShop we used the term "cookie" a lot in its traditional
meaning: opaque pointer, something a client may pass to the server,
and the server doesn't know or care what the "cookie" represents;
it then passes it back to the client who can interpret it.  In glue
it's actually called a routing token, which is a better description
of what it is.
<p>
In any case, in WorkShop it was just a <code>void *</code>. When
WorkShop sent a request to dbx, it would also sent along a cookie,
and when WorkShop heard back from dbx, the results would be accompanied
by the cookie sent with the request.  
<p>
This was used to route results appropriately. For example, a balloon
evaluation request from an editor would include a reference to the
editor object, so when the result came back we could find out which
editor was waiting for the result by just looking at the pointer.
<p>
In Java we don't have the same luxury - there are no <code>void
*</code>'s, so instead the routing token is not an <code>int</code>.
<p>
The question is, how do we use the int?
<p>
We have two needs from the routing token:
<ol>
 <li> Identify the component/subsystem in the IDE that this result
	needs to be routed to
 <li> That subsystem probably needs a further tag/id to manage
      the result. For example, if we've tried to modify a breakpoint,
      and we get an error message back, it would be helpful in addition
      to identifying this as a breakpoint problem, we had the relevant
      breakpoint id.
</ol>

<p>
To solve this problem, I propose that we use the 32 bit integer
as follows: the LOWEST 8 bits are used to identify the subsystem.
Note: I'm not talking about 8 possibilities here (one bit for each),
I'm talking about 256.   Then, the remaining 24 bits are used
as an ID for the subsystem.
<p>
Note that there any no big-endian/small-endian issues here. If you're
not convinced, read the fine print.
<h6><sup>
Cookies are opaque to anyone but the client. They have no business
mucking with it. The same Java process will both create and
interpret cookies - everybody else just passes it on, bit for bit.
